### Issues
#### Working as a team being in constact communication is key. We do run into a merge issues with our branches.
### What we learned:
- When working as a team, make sure to work in the latest version of the repository.
- git pull origin main it is a must, so you do not override the previous work of your team.
- ![Image Updating the repository](https://github.com/Vivonzty15/Milestone_Project2/blob/main/Images/git%20pull%20origin%20main.png)
- Connecting the Front-End with Back-End.
- Running Back-end and Front-end syncronized.
- Score in our questions

### Work In Progress
- Original Idea was to do a Trivia game with a social media included, the social profile part of the game is work in process
- Score board. Right now everyone that plays our Trivia game is going to be a genius, since the part of evaluating each question as right or wrong still work in process.
